We hunger for health and happiness - this plan satisfies our hunger.

The basic reason people are fatter than ever before is they are eating more nutrient dense food than ever before. Period.

On top, activity, sleep and stress habits make it worse.

#### The Human Body! ####
The human body is a complex system, consisting of trillions of different types of living digestive bacteria, viruses, and fungi living in every microscopic nook and cranny, plus approximately 37.2 trillion human cells.

In this fantastic system, energy is balanced, with the food you eat powering a cascade of physical reactions.
Ultimately, the energy in flows out through motion and reactions of each component of your body.

#### The Food Industry ####
The food industry, and others, have successfully created an ever-growing abundance of cheap and energy-dense food.

Humans, and nearly every other animal, plant and other creature alive, instinctively search out the most energy-dense foods.

For prehistoric man in wild Nature, nutrient-dense food makes evolutionary sense; those consuming scarce energey-dense food will have greater ability to reproduce.

A possible defintion of modern human, might be those homo sapiens for whom raw evolutionary is not directly correlated with ealth and happiness. In fact, for you are me, __eating nutrient dense foods doesn't make us healthier or happier__

In fact, nutrient dense foods are the single biggest contributor to obesity, metabolic disease, unhealthy microbiomes, and generaly human unhappiness in modern America, period.

There are various elites that know this in one way or another - hippies, hipsters, yuppies, yupsters, vegans, paleo fanatics, keto junkies, and the like.
This book is a set of instructions and a conversation that anyone, young __or__ old, fat __or__ thin, rich __or__ poor can follow to lose weight and become happier and healthier.
