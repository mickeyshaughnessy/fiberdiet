Despite the prevalence of modern diet fads and billions of dollars spent on ways to lose weight, Americans are fatter than ever before.
As a scientist, I've investigated the situation and I've found the cause and a simple way forward.
It'll work for you, regardless of your situation.
Follow the instructions in this book and you will lose weight, possibly a lot.
In addition, you'll feel more energetic and be happier and healthier.
We hunger for health and happiness - this plan satisfies our hunger.

The basic reason people are getting fatter than ever before is they are eating more nutrient dense food than ever before.
Additionally, exercise, sleep and stress habits make it worse.

The human body is complex system, consisting of trillions of living digestive bacteria, viruses, fungi and bacteria that live in every nook and cranny, plus approximately 37.2 trillion human cells.
Energy is balanced in this system, with the food you eat powering an incredibly complex and dynamic series of reactions.
Ultimately, the energy you provide in, flows out through the motion and reactions of each component of your body.

The food industry, and others, have over time created an abundance of cheap and energy dense food.
Humans, and nearly every other animal, plant and other creature alive, instinctively search out the most energy dense foods.
In the wild, nutrient dense food makes evolutionary sense, since high energy density means creatures consuming the food will have greater ability to reproduce.
For modern humans, though, evolutionary success and reproduction are separated from health and happiness, and therefore __eating nutrient dense foods doesn't make us healthier or happier__

In fact, nutrient dense foods are the single biggest contributor to obesity, metabolic disease, unhealthy microbiomes, and generaly human unhappiness in modern America, period.

There are various elites that know this in one way or another - hippies, vegans, paleo fanatics, keto junkies, and the like.
